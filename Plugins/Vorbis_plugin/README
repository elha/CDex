Winamp plugin

WARNING: This plugin is deprecated in favour of the nullsoft-written one
 available on www.winamp.com. 

You'll need the winamp plugin headers to compile this - available from the 
Nullsoft developer site. 
libvorbis and libvorbisfile both compile on win32 now, so you'll need to build 
them, then build this linked to those.

For most people, a binary is far more useful - once the bitstream format has 
finalised (soon) someone will get a dll up for Joe Average User to download.

For the rest of you - either figure out how to compile it, or bug either of us
for some win32 makefiles/project files. 

Definately works under MSVC 5, other compilers should be fine too.
